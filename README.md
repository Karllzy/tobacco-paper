# Band Selection for an Online Sorting System for Tobacco


## Data preprocessing
We conduct a series of pre-processing steps including the black-white calibration(done by C program when data was collected), bandwised signal-noize rate thresholding, data smoothing, Multiplicative Scattering Correction(MSC) and Standard Normal correction (SNC).

Detailed preprocessing steps can be found in this [file](./01_data_preprocess.ipynb).

The data preprocessed and raw data were saved under the folder dataset. The whole folder can be downloaded from both BaiduNetDisk or GoogleDrive:
